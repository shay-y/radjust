### radjust: Replicability Adjusted p-values for Two Independent Studies with Multiple Endpoints

<!--
Given p-values from two independent studies with multiple endpoints (features), the functions in the package return the adjusted p-values for false discovery rate control on replicability claims. 

In replicability analysis we seek to reject the null hypothesis of no replicability in favor of the alternative hypothesis of replicability: that the findings were replicated across the studies.  
We do so by testing for rejection in __both__ studies. This is in contrast to a typical meta-analysis, where the test can also reject when only a single finding is extreme enough.

The procedures implemented in the functions guarantee false discovery rate control (when testing multiple endpoints in each study) by comparing the adjusted p-values to the rate threshold (typically alpha = 0.05).

The function `radjust_sym` fits to a design of two studies, where the features for replicability are first selected in each study separately. 

The function `radjust_pf` fits to a design of primary and follow-up studies, where the features in the follow-up study are selected from the primary study.

#### Examples

Using `radjust_sym`:

```{r example1}

library(radjust)

## transform the example two-sided p-values to one-sided in the same direction (left):
## (we use the direction of the test statistic to do so and assume that it is continuous)
pv1 <- ifelse(mice$dir_is_left1, mice$twosided_pv1/2, 1-mice$twosided_pv1/2)
pv2 <- ifelse(mice$dir_is_left2, mice$twosided_pv2/2, 1-mice$twosided_pv2/2)

radjust_sym(pv1, pv2, input_type = "all", directional_rep_claim = TRUE, variant = "adaptive", alpha=0.025)
```

Primary and follow-up studies (`radjust_pf`):

```{r example2}
rv  <- radjust_pf(pv1 = crohn$pv1, pv2 = crohn$pv1, m = 635547)
head(rv)
```

#### Installation

You can install radjust from github with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("shay-y/radjust")
```

#### How to cite

Use the `citation()` R function:

```{r citation}
citation("radjust")
```
