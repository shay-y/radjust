\title{Adjust p-values for Replicability across Two Independent, Primary and Follow-up, Studies with Multiple Endpoints}
\usage{
radjust_pf(pv1, pv2, m, c2 = 0.5, l00 = 0, variant = c("none",
  "general_dependency", "use_threshold"), threshold = NULL,
  alpha = 0.05)
}
\arguments{
\item{pv1}{numeric vector of p-values from the primary study which
corresponds to the p-values from the follow-up study (\code{pv2}).}

\item{pv2}{numeric vector of p-values from the follow-up study.}

\item{m}{the number of features examined in the primary study (> \code{length(pv1)}).}

\item{c2}{the relative boost to the p-values from the \strong{follow-up} study.
\code{c2 = 0.5} (the default) is recommended. It was observed in simulations to yield
similar power to procedure with the optimal value (which is unknown for real data).}

\item{l00}{a lower bound of the fraction of features (out of m) with true null hypotheses in both studies.
For example, for GWAS on the whole genome, the choice of 0.8 is conservative in typical applications.}

\item{variant}{\describe{
   \item{none}{the default.}
   \item{general_dependency}{use \eqn{m^*=m\sum_{i=1}^{m}\frac{1}{i}}{m*=m*sum(1/i)} instead of \code{m}.}
   \item{use_threshold}{c1 is computed given the \code{threshold} value.}
}
Both variants guarantee that the procedure that declares as replicated all features with r-values below \code{alpha},
controls the FDR at level \code{alpha}, for any type of dependency of the p-values in the primary study.}

\item{threshold}{the selection threshold for p-values from the primary study; must be supplied when
variant 'use_threshold' is selected, otherwise ignored.}

\item{alpha}{The FDR level to control.}
}
\value{
vector of length of \code{pv1} and \code{pv2}, containing the r-values.
}
\description{
Given two vectors of p-values from the primary and follow-up studies, returns the adjusted p-values for false
discovery rate control on replicability claims. The p-value vectors are only for features selected for follow-up.
}
\details{
When many hypotheses are simultaneously examined in a primary study, and then a subset of hypotheses
 are forwarded for follow-up in an independent study, it is of interest to know which findings are replicated across studies.
 As a measure of replicability of significance, we compute the r-value, i.e. the FDR adjusted replicability p-value, for each hypothesis followed-up.
 This measure is different than the FDR adjusted p-value in a typical meta-analysis, where a p-value close to zero in one of
 the studies is enough to declare the finding as highly significant. The FDR r-value for a feature is the smallest FDR level
 at which we can say that the finding is among the replicated ones.
