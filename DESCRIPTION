Description: The functions in the package calculate adjusted p-values for the null hypothesis of no replicability
 across studies for two study designs: (i) a primary and follow-up study, where the features in the follow-up study
 are selected from the primary study; (ii) two independent studies, where the features for replicability are first
 selected in each study separately. The latter design is the one encountered in a typical meta-analysis of
 two studies, but the inference is for replicability rather than for identifying the features that are nonnull
 in at least one study.
