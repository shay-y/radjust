Description: This package provides the adjusted p-values for the null hypothesis of no replicability 
  across studies for two study designs: a primary and follow-up study, where the features in the follow-up study 
  are selected from the primary study; two independent studies, where the features for replicability are first 
  selected in each study separately. The latter design is the one encountered in typical meta-analysis of 
  two studies, but the inference is for replicability rather than for identifying the features that are nonnull
  in at least one study.
