# radjust: Replicability Adjusted p-values for Two Independent Studies with Multiple Endpoints

Given p-values from two independent studies with multiple endpoints
(features), the functions in the package return the adjusted p-values
for false discovery rate control on replicability claims.

In replicability analysis we seek to reject the null hypothesis of no
replicability in favor of the alternative hypothesis of replicability:
that the finding replicated across the studies.  
We do so by testing for signal in both studies. This is in contrast to a
typical meta-analysis, where the test can also reject when only a single
study has signal.

The procedures implemented in the functions compute the adjusted
p-values for FDR control on replicability claims. By declaring as
replicability discoveries the features with adjusted p-values (termed
r-values) below the desired nominal level (e.g., 0.05), the FDR on
replicability claims is controlled at the nominal level. See Bogomolov
and Heller (2013), Heller, Bogomolov and Benjamini (2014), and Bogomolov
and Heller (2018) for details.

The function `radjust_sym` should be used for replicability analysis of
two independent studies, each examining multiple features. The features
for replicability are first selected in each study separately based on
the results of that study.

The function `radjust_pf` should be used for replicability analysis of a
primary study and an independent follow-up study, where the features in
the follow-up study are selected from the primary study.

## Examples

Using `radjust_sym`:

``` r
library(radjust)

## transform the example two-sided p-values to one-sided in the same direction (left):
## (we use the direction of the test statistic to do so and assume that it is continuous)
pv1 <- ifelse(mice$dir_is_left1, mice$twosided_pv1/2, 1-mice$twosided_pv1/2)
pv2 <- ifelse(mice$dir_is_left2, mice$twosided_pv2/2, 1-mice$twosided_pv2/2)

radjust_sym(pv1, pv2, input_type = "all", directional_rep_claim = TRUE, variant = "adaptive", alpha=0.05)
```

    > Note: pv1 and pv2 have the same length and don't have names
    >   -> matching features by location.

    > Note: Directional replicability claim option is set to TRUE.
    >   Make sure you have entered the *left* sided p-values.

Primary and follow-up studies (`radjust_pf`):

``` r
rv  <- radjust_pf(pv1 = crohn$pv1, pv2 = crohn$pv1, m = 635547)
head(rv)
